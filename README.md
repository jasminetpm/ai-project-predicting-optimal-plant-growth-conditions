# AIAP Batch 19 Technical Assessment

Create Machine Learning models to predict the temperature conditions within the farm's closed environment, ensuring optimal plant growth. 
Additionally, develop models to categorise the combined "Plant Type-Stage" based on sensor data, aiding in strategic planning and resource allocation.
By implementing these models, I will help AgroTech Innovations improve crop management, optimise resource usage, and increase yield predictability. 
These efforts will not only enhance current operations but also provide valuable insights for future agricultural innovations.
